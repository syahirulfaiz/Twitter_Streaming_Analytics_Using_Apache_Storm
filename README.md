From the result obtained, we predict the party which has probability to win is Labour Party (36.9%), followed by Brexit (24.8%) and Conservative (12.6%) as the top three. On the other hand, the parties which have the least probability (more likely to lose) are Yorkshire Party, Liberal Party, The Social Democratic Party, Monster Raving Loony Party, and Christian People Alliance Party (0.001% each). 
However, the real result of 2019 General Election (‘votes’ column) announces that Conservative as the winner (43.6%), followed by Labour (32.1%), and Liberal Democrat (11.6%) as the top three. Compared to our result, this might be according to limited monitoring time and lack of supporting factors. If we have more time to monitor the Twitter, gathering more relevant key supporters then it would give different result. Therefore, it is obvious that our prediction is not accurate.
